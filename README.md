# Soccer-Pong

This project is about using Pygame to build a soccer-like Pong game. The code is based on the pong11_sprites.py code from the Pong_in_Pygame repo 
by Clear Code, and will be modified further as more updates are made. Credit for the paddle assets also goes to Clear Code. 


Code is subject to updates.
